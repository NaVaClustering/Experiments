# Text Clustering without Ground Truth
In this section, we will present text clustering experiments on datasets where there is no pre-defined manual labeling. Therefore, in these experiments, we will evaluate the ability of \model~ and our baselines to find consistent clusters by evaluating unsupervised learning metrics where the labels are not known.
